# PeripheralsManager

Don't you hate it when you're travelling with a laptop and you have different headphones/mouse than at home? And once you get back home, you have to change volume of all apps and/or try and work effieciently while using two different mouse sensitivities. I'm not even talking about gaming - there can not having only one sens. be a real burden.

__Well, today's your lucky day, cause this app is here to solve exactly this problem!__

It allows you to set up different "profiles" made up from the configuration in which you have a certain audio device or your mouse sensitivity.  
Then, with a simple click of your mouse, you can switch to the saved profile anytime you desire.

This app runs as a little tray-icon application, hidden in the app drawer and always ready for you.

## installation:
Download the `.exe` and run it! That's is.

Also it is required to have dotnet runtime installed on your system. But all modern windows installations have it already. If you don't, the error message will direct you on how to get it.

## usage:
Log in with your account (or create a new one, if you don't have it) {btw, if I get fed up with this, I might implement the database locally, so no more logging and required internet connection. For more news, star this project so you don't miss new releases.}

After you log in, select "New profile" from the menu or switch to an existing profile. The rest should be pretty self-explanatory.

## notice
1. this app only runs on Windows, as it uses specific API functionality
2. it has been made as a school project and I didn't have time to finish it. So currently it exists only as a early proof of concept.  
But I'll likely revisit it in the future, because I like this concept and would like to create a full app from it.  
However there is a working backend for this application: https://github.com/3ncy/PeripheralsManager_Backend
